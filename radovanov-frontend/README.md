# New Frontend Client for Studapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0. It represents a continuously evolving version of the frontend client for the Studapp project. This base was provided by my professor, and I've been enhancing it with additional features as part of lab assignments. 

This client replaces an older one, which is located in the `backend` repository. Despite the older version having more recent package dependencies, I decided to adopt this client and plan on updating it to a more recent version of Angular, along with other packages. I'm hoping to do this as soon as I gather enough courage! :)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
